# wordle-bot
A simple bot to help solve Wordle. I'll add documentation another day.

Run play_wordle.py from the terminal to get the bot's help on your daily Wordle. Run first_words.py if you want to use your computing power to analyze how good some of the words in words.txt are to start out with. It will pick up where I left off. (I have not run it for long enough to work through the whole list yet.)
